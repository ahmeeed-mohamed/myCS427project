My project for security cource CS427 with Dr.Husaain Almohri and Dr.Mohamed soud .

The project for Secure Remote Procedure Call using Andrew RPC protocol .

Now its the first phase of the project. 

I have 4 files:

client1 and server1 : server should work first then client connect to server. They send massege between them 
with ecncription and decription method with key store on them.

client2 and server2 : server should work first then client connect to server. They send massege between them 
with ecncription and decription method with generat key when the client connect to server and store it in file then 
the client read it from the file to encrypt and decrypt the massage.

client3 and server3 : they are the final files that i made for rpc andrew protocol that the server authenticate the client 
with identifier and the server will red from key.txt the identefier and his or her key to encrypt and decrypt mesaage between them 

Problems i faceed:

1)its's my frist time to use python so i faced some problems in encode and decode 
2)how to encrypt or decrypt strings (it should be converted to bytes to encrypt or decrypt then decode or encode it )


Its a good experince to have a new language to use and its easy to learn 

Hope I made it in a good ways and help another student to know it 

Thank you
